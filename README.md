# Train-Activity-Basic

This project was designed using moment.js to calculate the schedule of trains added by the user.

To add a train, follow the form on the page and fill in the following- Train Name: Destination: First Train Time (in hh:MM format): Frequency (in minutes format):

By clicking submit your train will be added to the schedule. Refreshing the page will update the "Next Arrival" and "Minutes Away" columns to the current times based on information given earlier.

The visuals were designed using bootstrap.
